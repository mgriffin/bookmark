# Bookmark

Store a local copy of interesting pages instead of keeping tabs open in a browser.

### Why?

I tend to accumulate tabs in my browser that I think are interesting and I'd like to refer back to.
This makes for an impossible to read list, so they should really be stored somewhere else.

### What?

This is a really rough and ready script to store a local copy of a page along with some metadata.
It works for me, it might also work for you.
